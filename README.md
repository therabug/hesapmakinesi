# Hesap Makinesi

A simple calculator built with **Rust** using **libadwaita / GTK4**. This project was created to learn GTK4 and Rust GUI development.

## Features

* ✅ Supports all four basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
* ✅ Parentheses support for complex expressions
* ✅ Safe and reliable (thanks to Rust!)

## Building & Running

This project uses **Cargo** for building and running. I love Rust.

```bash
# Run directly
cargo run

# Build release version
cargo build --release
```

> ⚠️ Note: Currently, this project does **not compile on Windows**. GTK is tricky to set up on Windows, so Linux/macOS is recommended.
